# Velocipede Vista: Crafting Insights from Global Cycling Data


# AdventureWorks Data Warehouse Project

## Overview

The project focuses on creating a data warehouse for AdventureWorks, a company in the bicycle sales industry, aiming to centralize and consolidate data for advanced analytics.


## Objectives

- Consolidate data from various sources for better reporting and analytics.
- Optimize data utilization for insightful analysis.

## ðŸ’¾ Dataset

**AdventureWorks** is a database provided by Microsoft for free on online platforms. It is a product sample database originally published by Microsoft to demonstrate the supposed design of a SQL server database using SQL server 2008. Here are some key points to know about AdventureWorks:
- AdventureWorks database supports a manufacturing MNC named Adventure Works Cycles.
- It is a sample Online Transaction Processing (or OLTP) database, which is a type of data processing where multiple transactions occur concurrently. These are shipped by Microsoft with all of their SQL server products.

> For this project I used the **Lightweight (LT) data**: a lightweight and pared down version of the OLTP sample. [Download here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms)

## Phases

1. **Define Requirements**: Understanding business goals, identifying data sources, and defining data granularity and architecture.
2. **ETL Workflow**: Steps for extracting, transforming, and loading data into the DW.
3. **Testing and Deployment**: Includes unit testing, integration testing, and deployment to production.

## Architecture

Adopts a star schema design for optimized query performance and simplicity.

## ETL Process

By using SSIS, I perform ETL process involves extracting data from Csv files, transforming it to fit our data warehouse schema, and loading it,also i have implemented incremental loading and SCD types to efficiently manage data updates.
