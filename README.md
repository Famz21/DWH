## üî¨ Project Overview 

This an end-to-end data engineering project on the Azure cloud. Where I did data ingestion from a on-premise SQL Server to Azure Data Lake using Data Factory to transformation using Databricks and Spark, loading to Synapse, and reporting using PowerBI. Also, I used Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault for the data monitoring and governance purpose. 

### üíæ Dataset

**AdventureWorks** is a database provided by Microsoft for free on online platforms. It is a product sample database originally published by Microsoft to demonstrate the supposed design of a SQL server database using SQL server 2008. Here are some key points to know about AdventureWorks:
- AdventureWorks database supports a manufacturing MNC named Adventure Works Cycles.
- It is a sample Online Transaction Processing (or OLTP) database, which is a type of data processing where multiple transactions occur concurrently. These are shipped by Microsoft with all of their SQL server products.

> For this project I used the **Lightweight (LT) data**: a lightweight and pared down version of the OLTP sample. [Download here](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorksLT2022.bak)
